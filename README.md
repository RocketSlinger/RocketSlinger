I'm Rocketslinger and I have a web site at www.Rocketslinger.com and I also post papers at ResearchGate.com ...  Under my real name of Titus Stauffer.  I just published a pare about testing Quantized Inertia at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388117533_Experiments_for_Testing_Quantized_Inertia_Theories and I want to get my paper onto a GitHub list of such papers, which is why I am registering here now.
